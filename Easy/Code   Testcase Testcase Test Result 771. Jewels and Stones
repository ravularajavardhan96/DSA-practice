Problem:You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. 
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.Letters are case
sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

/**
 * Returns the number of jewels present in the given stones.
 * Trims leading/trailing spaces and splits by one or more whitespace characters.
 * 
 * @param jewel , stones strings
 * @return The count of jewels present in stones
 */

/*
Approach
The moment when I seen this problem, I thought its very easy and it was I used nested for loop and its done.

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        int counter=0;
        for(int i=0;i<jewels.length();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<stones.length();j++){
                if(jewels.charAt(i) == stones.charAt(j)){
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}

Example:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
